This is the Wordpress theme designed by me, for demo you can see http://tingchen.info. Note: The theme is not perfectly mature upto this moment, I put it here to make it easy for code control.

To setup this theme:
* First, you need to hack the kernel file (wp-blog-header.php) of WP first, change:
	wp();
* to
	$url_array = explode('?', $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
	if ( isset($_GET['s']) and ! isset($_GET['view']) ):
		$url_array[1] .= '&view=cat';
		$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] .= '&view=cat';
	endif;
	wp($url_array[1]);
* Second, you active the theme like a normal theme.

Some of theme features:
* Very simple and clear UI and information display.
* Posts quality control and filter (also RSS enabled).
* Catalog view.
* Auto scrolling (such as twitter).
* Protected posts hided.
